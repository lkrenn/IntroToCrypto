    "# ETH Valuation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will be looking at a valuation strategy presented by John Pfeffer in his paper An (Institutional) Investor's Take on Cryptoassets. In the paper, Pfeffer posits that the total network value of a cryptocurrency is analogous to the money supply, M. M is measured as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Money Supply} =~\\frac{\\text{Price}\\times\\text{Quantity}}{\\text{Velocity}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to adjust this formula to the world of cryptocurrencies, we would get the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\text{Total Network Value} =~\\frac{\\text{Total Cost of Consumed Computational Resources}}{\\text{Velocity}}\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This seems to be a natural first step, and acts as a foothold to wrap our heads around the valuation of a crypto. If we jump to page 10, Pfeffer gives us an idea of valuing ETH under the assumption that the only value it has is as a utility token. "
